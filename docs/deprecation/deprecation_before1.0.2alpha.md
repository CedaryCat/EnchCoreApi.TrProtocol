**EnchCoreApi.TrProtocol**
===
### A efficient terraria packet serializer and partial protocol implement.
___
* This project automatically builds efficient and unsafe working code through IIncrementalGenerator. 
In addition, it provides an additional patch for OTAPI, by extracting some shared types to achieve friendly compatibility with OTAPI. 
Therefore, by using this specially designed OTAPI,
the data structures provided by the protocol library can be used directly in terraria's server programs.
* This package is deprecated.  Please upgrade to version 1.0.2-Beta2 or later, which resolves a bug in 1.0.2-alpha1 or earlier that caused some fields to be serialized incorrectly due to missing conditionals. Thanks for understanding ^_^
