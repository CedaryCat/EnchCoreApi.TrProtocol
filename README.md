* This project automatically builds efficient and unsafe working code through IIncrementalGenerator.In addition, it provides an additional patch for OTAPI, by extracting some shared types to achieve friendly compatibility with OTAPI.
* This project is based on the protocol data structures from another project by [chi-rei-den](https://github.com/chi-rei-den).I have used their data structures as a reference and modified them according to my own needs. I would like to acknowledge and appreciate their work and contribution. You can find their original project at [TrProtocol](https://github.com/chi-rei-den/TrProtocol).
